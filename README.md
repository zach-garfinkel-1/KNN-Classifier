# KNN-Classifier
Defining a KNN Classifier and applying it to the Titanic Dataset

This notebook uses Datascience, a more simple and intuitive module made for learning purposes, instead of Pandas, which might be unfamiliar to some

I achieved 88.32% or 121/137, surprisingly a better result than I was able to get with Random Forest, PCA, T-SNE, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks
